- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrandonU27
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering and finding out how things work around me. I love to relax by playing video games other then that youll find me on my computer learning as much as possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Full Sail University. In their Computer Science BS program.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. The more I do the more I learn. I'm open to tips and will be happy to see if I could do something better.
- 📫 How to reach me? My Twitter user is brandon_untea
