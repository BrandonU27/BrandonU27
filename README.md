👋 Hi, I’m @BrandonU27
👀 I’m passionate about software engineering and have a major interest in understanding the intricacies of technology around me. You'll often find me immersed in learning on my computer.
🌱 I hold a BS in Computer Science from Full Sail University, equipped with comprehensive knowledge in software development.
🏓 I possess a unique knack for mastering programming languages like C++, Rust, and C#, often exploring unconventional solutions to challenging problems.
💼 Open to collaboration opportunities across diverse projects. I thrive on continuous learning and welcome constructive feedback to enhance my skills.

PS. Apologies in advance if you ask me for a language recommendation and all you hear is Rust this and Rust that. (It's a bit of a habit!)
